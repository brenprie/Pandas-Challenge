    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Your analysis here (from perspective of Chief Data Scientist for city's school district, to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities):\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Across all 15 schools in the district, only 65% of students are passing both math and reading; 82% and 75% of students are passing reading only and math only, respectively.\n",
    "* At the same time, comparison of the five top-performing and five bottom-performing schools, as well as performance by expeditures per student, reveal that lower-performing schools have larger budgets and spend more per student. This evidence can help rebutt claims that a lack of resources per se may be behind the underperformance of some schools in the district -- this is not the case. Indeed, the causation has likely run in the opposite direction, with lower-performing schools being allocated more funds on a per-pupil basis in an effort to offset other factors driving the education performance imbalance. Toward identifying root causes, and in turn potentially fruitful solutions, factors worth exploring as possibly contributing to the performance differential include school condition, teacher quality, student-to-teacher ratios, and dynamics in the home and broader community.\n",
    "* In support of school size having some explantory power, one finds for both reading and math little performance difference between small and medium-sized schools but a substantial difference between medium and large schools. Additional data on teacher populations and class sizes could allow for more granular inference along this dimension. The evidence further points to a strong positive correlation between school type and student performance, with charter schools associated with a significant performance advantage on average and substantially higher performance on a percentage-passing basis. From the persepctive of delivering the most education value for the dollar, more attention should be given to how we might expand charter schools within the district or how elements of charter schools could be adapted to the benefit of district schools.\n",
    "* With respect to performance as students progress from the 9th to 12th grades within a given school, the data consistently show little variation both over time and across the district's schools, suggesting that one's academic performance as they enter the 9th grade is a good predictor of their performance as they exit the 12th grade, that is, the effects of those factors driving differences in performance are persistent. This finding also highlights the importance of early education before pupils arrive to the 9th grade.  \n",
    "* As a next step, I recommend analyzing performance data over time, toward: i) identifying shifting patterns if any, ii) sheddling light on the impact of prior efforts to boost students' performance district-wide, and iii) informing development of a 5-year plan the the of 100% passing rates on math and reading in all schools in the district within X years."
